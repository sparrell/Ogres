# Frequently Asked Questions

For now this is md. Intent will be to move into codebase
as part of Ogre instantiations.

## What is schedule for this project?
Initial effort is focused on a plugfest/hackathon
planned as part of the
Cybersecurity Automation Workshop
just prior to
[RSAC](https://www.rsaconference.com/usa)
so results can be used at the
[Supply Chain Sandbox](https://supplychainsandbox.org/)
portion of RSAC as part of
[QuadBlockQuiz](https://supplychainsandbox.org/quadblocks).

## What is relation of Ogres to PACE?
blah blah blah

## What is relation of Ogres to SBOM?
blah blah blah

## What is relation of Ogres to OpenC2?
All command and control over PACE integration bus
may be performed (i.e. not precluding other methods)
using OpenC2 commands.

More on OpenC2 can be found
[here](https://openc2.org/).

One objective of the Ogres work is to assist in the development
of the necessary OpenC2 commands to meet the usecases desired.

The Ogres codebase includes an OpenC2 API.

## Where can I find SBOMs to use as data for Ogres?
need to make another repo for this
