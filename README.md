# Ogres
Open Graph Repository in Elixir for Sboms (OGRES)

This repo is for the study of using
Graph databases for storing
Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).

In particular, it is for
[PACE](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/PACE)
and the study of using graph databases for the storage
and evaluation of
[Software Bill of Materials](https://www.cisa.gov/sbom)
(SBOM).
Some example use cases can be found
[here](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/PACE/blob/main/docs/Pace_Sbom_Vex_Flags_Prioritization/README.md).

One direction of study is which type of graph database
(LPG, RDF,...) is best, so many types will be incorporated.
The base software to interface and compare these database types
is from the book

Editor's note - awaiting permission of author/publisher to include.
